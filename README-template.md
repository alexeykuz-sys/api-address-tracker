## Overview

The idea of this project is to build a page allowing user to see the location of the IP address. The page has to be mobile first and be fully responsive on all creen sizes. The technology used for the project is [LeafletJS](www.leafletjs.com) and  [GeoIpify](www.geo.ipify.org)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
